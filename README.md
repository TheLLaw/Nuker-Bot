# Nuker
Nuke bot writen in python.

You need to edit the code and change the "URID" to your discord id and open the token file to put your bots token.

Contact me on discord if needed Law#7419

The bot is supposed to be a wikipedia search bot.

I'm not responsible for the use of the bot, raiding is against discord's TOS this bot is not supposed to be used like that. I can't make you don't use it that way and I don't want to. I just want to make sure that I'm not responsible for the usage of this program/bot.
